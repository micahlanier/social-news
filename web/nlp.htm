		<h1>Natural Language Processing</h1>
		<p>The textual nature of social media provides a rich corpus for analysis. These represent our efforts to extract meaning from the words we collected.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Sentiment Analysis <small>What makes 140 characters positive or negative?</small></h2>
	<p>Stuff here.</p>
	
	<h2>Topic Modeling <small>What are publishers talking about?</small></h2>
	<p>Topic modeling is an automatic way to generate a topic for an article. The computer selects a set of representative words from all corpus as a dictionary. Then it selects some words of this dictionary for each topic. Finally, it classifies each topic to the different topics.</p>
	
</div>

<div class="container">
	<!-- Edit main content here. -->
	<p>We used the two additional python liveries, nltk and gensim to auto generate the topic for each post of twitter and facebook. In general, there are two steps of topic generation. The first step is to lemmatize each post and build dictionary. The second step is to build the topic model and generate topic for each post.</p>
	<!-- End content editing. -->
</div>

<div class="container">

	<h4>Lemmatizing posts <small>Make the texts recognizable for machine.</small></h4>
	<p>In order to input the texts to train the topic model, we need to clean the text and transform it to the format that is understandable for computer.</p>
	<ol type="1">
     <li>Eliminate stop words: stop words are generally functional but meaningless in a sentence, such as "the", "that", "and"...etc.
	  We remove them from posts since they are not representative.</li>
	 <dl>* example of some stop words: 'a', 'about', 'above', 'after', 'again', 'against', 'all', 'am', 'an', 'and', 'any', 'are', 'as',
           'at', 'be', 'because', 'been', 'before'...ect.</dl>
	 <li>Eliminate patterned word: some special formatted words are used in twitter or facebook posts, such as the words after #, @ RT...etc.
	  Mostly those words are not a real word we can find in dictionary so computers cannot process them.</li>
     <li>Lemmatization: map the different forms of a words back to its original form.</li>
	 <dl>For example,  it maps "gone", "went", "goes" to go.</dl>
     <li>Morphology: Identify the morphological features of each words in a text. We only preserve nouns because they are more representative in topics.</li>
	 <li>Dictionary: Build the dictionary of these lemmatized words. We would have the statistical summary of the words in this dictionary.
	  We can further eliminate words based on the words' frequency. We did no do this because the posts of twitter and facebook are generally very short. A filter based on how many posts a word appears is not suitable here.</li>
    </ol>

</div>

<div class="container">
	<!-- Edit main content here. -->
	<h4>Building LDA Model <small>Train the topic model and classify the posts.</small></h4>
	<p>The LDA Model is essentially a classifier, which classifies the posts to different groups. Then, it gives a about ten words as the name of each class. These ten words would be the topics.</p>
	<ol type="1">
     <li>Build the LDA model based on the dictionary in the previous step. Some parameters need setting in this model.
	  One of the most important is the number of topics. We tuned this parameter to 500 based on the final result.</li>
	 <li>Generate topics from the LDA model. The number of topics would be what we determined.</li>
	 <li>Put the lemmatized posts into our model. The LDA model would classify each post to one of the topics.</li>
    </ol>  
	<!-- End content editing. -->
</div>

<div class="container">
	<!-- Edit main content here. -->
	<h4>The top topics in twitter and facebook</h4>
	<p>The topics generated by LDA model are only words any ratio of them appeared in the posts classified to this topic. 
	In order to make the result more presentable, we manually changed the topics to more human readable ones.</p>

	<h5><b>The different groups of news organizations have very different preference of topics:</b></h5>
	<p>The top 10 topics from Twitter are a bit different from the top 10 list from Facebook. Again, New York shows up at the very top of the list. Some similar issues that were discussed heavily on Twitter were President Obama (minus the immigration policy), ISIS, White House, and Ebola. However, there were a couple of topics that were not on Facebook. For example, on Twitter we find Women's Issues, Listicles, and Bill Cosby. Furthermore, we observe due to the 140 character limit, the LDA topic model gave us concise results that were much easier to interpret.</p>
	<p>From the above table, there are several interesting observations we can draw. First, we find the Teal group's content on twitter to be very different from the rest of the three groups. The main differences are on the topics ISIS (ranked 95), Ebola (31), and Ebola in Texas (ranked 60, 65). While these topics are ranked in the top 10 for the entire 25 news organizations, these topics are not heavily reported on by Slate, ABC News, and The Daily Beast. In addition, the topics reported by the Green group on Twitter is very different from those reported on Facebook, specifically, ISIS has now moved up from 301 to 14. However, overall, most of the top 10 topics for the entire 25 news organizations are still under represented in the Green group.</p>

	<h5><b>The different groups of news organizations have very different preference of topics:</b></h5>
	<p>The above table shows the top 10 topic in Facebook posts posted by the 25 news organizations. We believe that the topic modeling performed reasonably well in that we see big topics that were heavily posted on during the September - November time frame. Some of the topics that readers might recognize are Ebola, President Obama's Immigration Policy, Hong Kong Protest, Midterm Senate Elections, White House, and ISIS. We are reasonably happy with the topic modeling results and find them to be within our expectation of what news organizations were reporting on.</p>
	<p>Using the results from the prior clustering analysis with social media metrics, we can also derive where the top 10 topics ranked for each of the groups. For example, from the above table, for the Green Group - New York City is ranked as the 11th most posted topic while for the entire 25 news organizations, it is ranked as the most posted topic.</p>
	<p>There are several interesting observations we can draw. First, we find the Green group's content on Facebook to be very different from the rest of the three groups. The main differences are on the topics Hong Kong Protests (ranked 301) and ISIS (ranked 132). While these topics are ranked in the top 10 for the entire 25 news organizations, these topics are not heavily reported by Huffington Post, USA Today, and Fox News. This is within our expectation of sensational news organizations compared to more serious journalistic organizations such as New York Times. In addition, the Teal group does not post much on Hong Kong Protests and the Red group does not put an emphasis on ISIS. While, for the Blue group, the ranking within the group is very similar to the overall 25 news organizations. This makes sense, since the Blue group has the majority of news organizations. We should note that Blue group is also comprised of the main traditional news outlets that would report on the more serious topics.</p>

	<h5><b>Limitations</b></h5>
	<p>Auto generated topics might not be representative. The topic model is forced to classify the posts as the number of topics we specified, rather than to classify the posts based on their similarity. Some posts with uncommon topic might be classified to the same group as another uncommon topic because their similar posts are too few. Some topics might be too popular so the classifier generates more than one topics for them because the model does not prefer too many posts classified in one topic, such as the topics “Ebola,” “Ebola in Texas” in twitter.</p>

	<h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
	<p>The topic modeling results reinforce the results we found in the clustering analysis with social media metrics. From the tables above, we see that the top 10 topics for the four groups are all very different. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that there is an association of different content/topics to differences in social metrics (likes, retweets, and etc). This makes intuitive sense as there are topics that are inherently more popular than others. This is what we observe in our data and in our news organizations clusters.</p>
