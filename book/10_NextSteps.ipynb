      "2. We might observe the influence of future news events on social media activity. Our dataset missed many news events in the past, including early coverage of the 2014 US midterm elections (though we obtained *lots* of recent coverage about it). Our window includes very little of the recent Michael Brown and Eric Garner grand jury decision coverage, reactions to *Rolling Stone*'s UVA sexual assault coverage, or other very recent stories. Looking to the future, news coverage of a newly-Republican US Senate and the ramp-up of the 2016 Presidential campaign might prove useful for our analysis.\n",

MongoDB appears to fit the bill perfectly, featuring native compatibility with our existing data storage formats. We eschewed using MongoDB due to the learning curve: our team has some experience using relational databases but no experience with MongoDB. The \"conceptual shift\" to using a NoSQL database made MongoDB appear infeasible given the time available and potential benefit."

      "While our topic analysis proved enlightening, it proved far more challenging than expected to implement. That limited our ability to employ topic modeling in predictive analysis or analyze the relationship between post subject matter and sentiment. In theory, the subject matter of a social media post (and its linked article) ought to be a *critical* component of its popularity. This is even more so for more specialized news organizations (e.g., the *Wall Street Journal* and its business coverage) or news organizations that are thought to cultivate a more partisan audience (e.g., Fox News and MSNBC)."
