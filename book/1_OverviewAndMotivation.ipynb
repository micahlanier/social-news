      "During a recent appearance as part of the IACS seminar series, New York Times Chief Data Scientist Chris Wiggins noted that virtually all news organizations have become startups: they are all firms \u201cin search of a scalable business model.\u201d In response to challenges of the digital age, many \u201ctraditional\u201d news organizations have expanded efforts to promote their content on social media websites like Facebook and Twitter as a new medium to garner traffic and users. We are interested in how these efforts differ among news organizations and how we might predict their success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stated formally, we have two broad questions about news organization activities on social media. The first is descriptive: how do different organizations use each social network, and how do their social media presences differ? The second is predictive: what measurable features of social media activity can predict popularity of news content? These questions fundamentally guide our later analysis and form the basis of the various angles of analysis that we pursue.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have identified 25 news organizations across several categories (newspapers, cable channels, wire services, etc.) to analyze. They are: The Boston Globe, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, USA Today, BBC, The Daily Mail, The Guardian, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, The Daily Beast, The Huffington Post, Slate, Agence France-Presse, The Associated Press, Reuters, Newsweek, Time, Yahoo News, and NPR News.\n",

      "Note that API configuration information is designed to be stored *outside* of the repository, as committing it to a public Github repository is (obviously) not a good idea. Raw data is (mostly) stored outside of Github as well, as it is quite voluminous and represents others' copyrighted work. That will limit the reader's ability to run this code as-is, but the authors are happy to assist where feasible."

      "Several of last year's [projects](http://rabeeaa.wordpress.com/cs109-final-project/) utilized social media data for analytical purposes, and researchers have begun to mine social media data to quite [startling ends](http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news-archive/16074.html). Rather than mine aggregate, general data, we have opted to focus on a narrower selection of accounts across media (both Facebook and Twitter) to divine details about the particular social strategies that they exhibit.\n",

      "While we believe that our analysis is unique in its breadth, our work is certainly inspired by past social media analysis of news content. Brian Abelson\u2019s [Pageviews Above Replacement](http://brianabelson.com/open-news/2013/11/14/Pageviews-above-replacement.html) paints a fascinating picture of pageviews that accrue to different types of content that [@nytimes](http://www.twitter.com/nytimes/) shares on Twitter, and lends insight into the potential strategic changes that might yield more traffic. Other enterprising engineers have, for example, built a Twitter bot that performs sentiment analysis on comments posted to [nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/) and reports on their aggregate positivity/negativity (this work has proven hard to find). Finally, Bitly [analyzed social media traffic](http://blog.bitly.com/post/22663850994/time-is-on-your-side) to its own links in 2012; their analysis is directly relevant to the last section of our submission, which relates to timing of social media posts.\n",

      "Notably, one of our team members worked previously for a major news organization and worked on a project with a team that analyzed the behavior of users \u201cacquired\u201d through social media channels. Without revealing many specifics, the analysis suggested that social media represent a promising audience-building tool if chanelled effectively. These two analyses are complementary: his prior analysis focused on user behavior *after* arrival on the website, while this project focuses on the social media activity that cultivated that traffic to begin with."
